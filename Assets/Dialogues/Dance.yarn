    BearBox: That's rude of you! Don't you know that this is UCL's mascot?
    <<SetSprite Right BearBox/Idle>>
    Squirrel: To be honest, we didn't really have it in the budget to get actual mascot costumes.

BearBox: Anyways, guys, gals, and nonbinary pals, it is with great pleasure that I announce the success of our fundraising campaign!
BearBox: Thanks to you all, we have raised an exorbitant amount of money!
<<SetSprite Right BearBox/Idle>>
BearBox: Unfortunately... we're not really sure what to do with it.
-> What do you mean you don't know what to do with it?!
BearBox: Well, some students want to use it to separate the UCs back into separate UCs.
BearBox: Other students have grown attached to UCL and want to use the money to improve and maintain it instead!
<<SetSprite Right BearBox/Blush>>
BearBox: And a great number of totally real students want to use it to buy me a giant bouncy castle!
<<SetSprite Right BearBox/Idle>>
Squirrel: We only have enough money for one of these options...
BearBox: Yeah... the bouncy castle costs a surprising amount of money.
Squirrel: So we're going to hold a raffle to decide how to spend the money!
Squirrel: If you all take a look at your dance tickets, you'll see a little number at the bottom!
Squirrel: The student with the winning ticket number will decide if UCL will stay as a consolidation of the UCs...
Squirrel: Or if UCL will be split back to its original colleges...
<<SetSprite Right BearBox>>
BearBox: Or if we can buy a bouncy castle!
Squirrel: ... Or if we can buy a bouncy castle. 
-> Hold up, shouldn't this decision be made by someone more qualified rather than a random student?
    Squirrel: That's a good point.
    Squirrel: But to be fair, poor financial administrative decisions got us into this mess in the first place. 
    Squirrel: It's only poetic to end the story how it started!
-> Why would we need a bouncy castle?
    BearBox: For bouncing silly! There are fewer things in life more pleasurable than jumping in a bouncy house!
    -> But shouldn't this decision be made by someone more qualified rather than a random student?
    Squirrel: That's a good point.
    Squirrel: But to be fair, poor financial administrative decisions got us into this mess in the first place. 
    Squirrel: It's only poetic to end the story how it started!
Squirrel: The winning student is...
Squirrel: Student number 123!
-> That's me!

BearBox: Now the fate of UCL rests solely in your hands...

BearBox: This year has been an eventful one thus far... and I want you to think deeply about what has become important to you when you make this decision.
BearBox: ... bouncy castle...
Player: What?
<<Shake Right>>
BearBox: What?
BearBox: It's the moment we've all been waiting for...
BearBox: What should we do with the budget?
-> Keep UCL
    BearBox: 
-> Break apart UCL!
    BearBox: Oh... Alright.
    BearBox: I was hoping that the campus would grow on you a bit... but...
    BearBox: I respect your decision.
    BearBox: We'll put the budget towards splitting up the school.
    BearBox: Thank you for coming everyone! It's been a great here at UCL, but all good things must come to an end.
