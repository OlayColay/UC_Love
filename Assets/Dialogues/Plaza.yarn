    BearBox: Welcome to the Plaza! I deliver food to students here, and I need you to use this drone's camera to direct me where to go, if you don't mind!
    <<SetSprite Middle BearBox/Idle>>
    BearBox: For some reason, people here will shove flyers to literally anything that has a face to shove them into, including me. 
    BearBox: Just the other day, I saw a squirrel get pelted by a USAC voting form that was folded into a ninja-star.
    BearBox: So I could really use your help avoiding these hooligans! You can direct me with the WASD keys. My wheels will get stuck if I get hit by 3 flyers.
    BearBox: Our client today will be at the North end of the plaza, so we have a sea of people to navigate through.
    BearBox: We could wait for it to die down a bit to make things Easy, or at least Medium, but that would pay less since it takes longer.
    <<SetSprite Middle BearBox/Blush>>
    BearBox: It's up to you though! To an ultimate lifeform like me, money is meaningless... except to perhaps buy a bouncy castle.
    <<Wait 1>>
